# About

This is a theme based originally on the Jekyll theme gem Minima, but with the integration of [Bulma](http://bulma.io) framework.

## Objectives

* Serve as the theme for my [personal page] (altodev.net)
* Be a side project to show off examples of the awesome Bulma framework
* Become a fleshed out theme you can use for a coherent mini-site
* Make the theme into a Bulma theme gem for Jekyll
* Continue to add docs and instructions

### TODOs

* Add install instructions to Readme file.
* Create a contact box includes item, with instructions on how to modify the contact form destination.
* Create a card-style includes item so people can add their own mini-bio to any page.
* Document how to add _includes items to pages, and how to make a new _includes item.
* Implement the full height hero with nav on header.front.html (logic is in place already).
* Make kramdown stles match Bulma
* Shortcut icons in head.html.
* Make the include item person.html pull from a folder of images and a json file for the info. So you can create a gallery.

## License

## Posts

Posts are, essentially, blog posts, or time-sensitive content.

### Adding posts

The best way to add a post is to copy the example post in the _posts folder. Change the front matter (the info at the top of the file) and the body text.

## Pages

Pages are documents with static info. Examples could be "About," "Contact," etc.

### Adding Pages

Pages can be added by copying and modifying a document inside the _pages file. When created, a new page will have its own menu item along the top nav.
