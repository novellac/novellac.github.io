Hi, I'm Novella. As a freelance Drupalista, I specialize in small projects and maintenance (SLA) client care. I am available for work remotely, in the greater Detroit area, or as a temporary embedded contractor.

For larger projects, I work with [Kafei Interactive Inc][kafei].

Passions I don't (yet!) get paid for include data science, Python, and science fiction.
