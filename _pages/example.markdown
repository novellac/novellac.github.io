This is the example page.

Above the three dashes, are a series of front matter.
Fill out the different categories according to the elements you'd like to use. 
The most important things to replace are "Title" and "Permalink," since this will determine what the page is calle, and where it can be found.
You may also want to fill out the "style" section with one of the five main styles Bulma provides:
 * primary
 * info
 * success
 * warning
 * danger

To add new pages, copy and edit this page and make it your own! 
If you want a new one, then simply add a file in the `_pages` directory that follows the convention `name-of-page.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. 
Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
