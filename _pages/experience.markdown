### Drupal related experience
------------------------------

####  Kafei Interactive Inc. (May 2014 - Present)

I have been an ongoing freelance contractor with Kafei Interactive Inc. since May 2014. Duties include:
* *Migration*: I have migrated sites of various sizes from D6 to D7 and D6 to D8. These sites have included Commerce and multilingual features.
* *Multilingual implementation*: I have been responsible for sitebuilding on multiple multilingual sites.
* *Sitebuilding*: I serve as the primary sitebuilder for both new and maintenance projects
* *Frontend*: I am the primary contact for frontend work. I have been responsible for frontend implementation on several new sites, and generally take the lead on any frontend requests which fit within SLA contracts.
* *Module development*: After building out Drupal sites, I conduct code review on contributed modules for possible inclusion, and am often responsible for setting out the requirements for custom modules. In addition, I have developed smaller custom modules for use in sites, or have made customizations of existing contributed modules.
* *QA*: I have done QA with Behat, as well as documented QA.
* *Project management*: I have served as project manager on both new builds and D2D migrations, and specialize in guiding client and developer communication through the migration process. In addition, I create and guide tickets for bugs and new features through the dev and deployment process.
* *Client Care/SLA Contact*: For our maintenance clients, in particular, I serve as a point of contact for general questions, maintenance and security updates, and new features.
* *Training*: For clients, I routinely create and update client documentation, create tutorial videos, and troubleshoot via email, phone, and video hangout.
