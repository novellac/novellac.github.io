### Technical experience

---

I have been an ongoing freelance contractor with Kafei Interactive Inc. since May 2014. Duties include:

- _Migration_: As part of a team, I have migrated sites of various sizes. These sites have included Commerce and multilingual features.
- _Multilingual implementation_: I have been responsible for sitebuilding (implementation and integration) on multiple multilingual sites.
- _Sitebuilding_: I serve as the primary sitebuilder for both new and maintenance projects.
- _Feature Development_: For new standalone features in legacy sites, I develop features in Vue, Nuxt, or raw HTML, using data from internal and extrnal REST endpoints.
- _Frontend_: I am the primary contact for frontend work. I have been responsible for frontend implementation on several new sites, and generally take the lead on any frontend requests which fit within SLA contracts.
- _Module/Plugin development_: I conduct code review on contributed modules/plugins for possible inclusion, and am often responsible for setting out the requirements for custom modules/plugins. In addition, I have developed smaller custom modules/plugsin for use in sites, or have customized existing contributed modules/plugins.
- _QA_: I have done QA with Behat and Cypress, as well as documented QA.
- _Project management_: I have served as project manager on both new builds and migrations, and specialize in guiding client and developer communication through the migration process. In addition, I create and guide tickets for bugs and new features through the dev and deployment process.
- _Client Care/SLA Contact_: For our maintenance clients, in particular, I serve as a point of contact for general questions, maintenance and security updates, and new features.
- _Training_: For clients, I routinely create and update client documentation, create tutorial videos, and troubleshoot via email, phone, and video hangout.
